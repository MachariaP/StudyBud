üí°IMPORTANT  Make sure you have finished Part Two of this project before proceeding

üí°IMPORTANT  Don‚Äôt forget to save your work at every step so that you won‚Äôt lose your progress

The last step for our agent is for it to send us an email every time it generates a new cover letter and CV. To set this up, click the ‚Äú+‚Äù icon on the last node followed by the  **Perform an action**  option, click on  **Gmail**  and then  **Send Email**.

Save your work, if you haven‚Äôt already, by providing a name to the Agent and you‚Äôre done!

  
Click the back arrow to go out of the Flow editor and you will be able to see the list of actions taken by the Agent as you save new Job postings using your google form.  

To test your work, open your google form and fill out a job detail. Here is a sample Job posting, fill it out and then click on ‚ÄúSubmit‚Äù

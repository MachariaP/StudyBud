Lindy will then open a  **Flow Editor**  similar to the below screen, click on  **Select Trigger**  and search for  **Google Sheets**  and then  **New Row Added**  option. We are choosing this because we want the agent to run as soon as a new record is saved to our Google Sheet.

On the left you should see several input fields -

**Folder**  - You can select a folder in your drive where the auto-generated cover letter will be stored. Create a folder if it doesn‚Äôt exist, I have named mine  `job applications`.

**Title**  - This field will be used to create the title of the cover letter to be generated. Since we are automating tasks with AI, we will choose to prompt AI to generate a title that matches our application. Select the Prompt AI option.

Prompt for Title- ‚ÄúWrite a title in the format of "Cover letter for < company name > : < position >‚Äù

**Content**  - We will also choose the Prompt AI option in the content field. In our prompt we will use the requirements filled into our form to generate the relevant cover letter contents.

Prompt for Content- ‚ÄúWrite a customized cover letter based on the position, the company, the description of the position, and the requirements [row] .‚Äù  
Note :  Be keen to replace [row] with the  `rowValues`  field from the spreadsheet as indicated on the screenshot. Also note that on your side you might not have  `rowValues`  depending on the version of google forms you used. If the field available is  `row`, use that instead.

Next add another action by clicking  **Perform an action**  option and select  **Create Document**  again. We will use this to create the customized CV. Select the same folder (or any folder you want your customized CV to be saved) and use the following prompts:

Prompt for Title  ‚ÄúWrite a title in the format of "CV for  :  ‚Äù

Prompt for Content  ‚ÄúUpdate my CV from your knowledge base [results] based on the requirements mentioned in [row]‚Äù
